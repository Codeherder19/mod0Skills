Instance of a door class: Steuben's Uptown Security door
1.) numberOfLocks = 2
2.) keyCode = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]
3.) closed = true
4.) color = "brown"

Methods:
1.) pushDoor changes the value of the closed boolean from true to false
2.) breakIn decreases the numberOfLocks to 0
3.) programKeyCode would change the array of the keyCode attribute, maybe based on user interface
4.) rePaint would change the color from brown to a different color
