Instance: Dinner table at Tony Roma's restaurant
Attributes
1.) numberOfLegs = 4
2.) splinters = true
3.) typesOfSilverware = ["knife", "fork", "spoon"]
4.) weightOfSalt = 66.6

I think I already did this in class1.txt but I"ll put it here as well.

break would decrease the value of numberOfLegs from 4 to 3
sandTable would change the splinters value to false
changeFromLunchToDinner would add "saladFork" and "wineGlass" to the array of typesOfSilverware
seasonFood would decrease the weightOfSalt float by 0.6
